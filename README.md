Palaeocontinental Reconstructions Simulation System

Title of the paper: PRSS to Aid Palaeocontinental Reconstructions Simulation Research 
Authors: Liang Feng, Chen Jianping, Yu Miao, Gong Fuxiu, Yu Pingping, Tian Hui
Description of the code: 
  The Palaeocontinental Reconstructions Simulation System (PRSS) was independently developed using a set of methods based on paleomagnetism, computer models of plate tectonics, motion characteristics on a spherical surface and relevant mathematical algorithms to analyse quantitatively and simulate dynamically plate motions during geologic history.
  PRSS is mainly intended for geoscientists who wish to study plate tectonics and produce palaeocontinental reconstructions. PRSS integrates many of the necessary functions required for this research: (1) Palaeocontinental reconstructions with known Euler data; (2) Palaeocontinental reconstructions based on palaeomagnetic data; (3) Use of spherical geometric principles to construct Euler poles; (4) Generating positions of continents at any geological time by interpolation algorithms.
